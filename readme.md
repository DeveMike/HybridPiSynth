# HybridPiSynth

A Raspberry Pi syntheziser with a modulation matrix which outputs CV or audio from hardware PWM pins. It can also read gate signals from GPIO and CV with some external analog circuitry. It's controlled using a primitive TUI. Currently no MIDI.

This is my first C project that never got finished but I'll leave it here as is because it was the synthesizer being used in [this song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4l9gOQfjVY&pp=ygUNc2hlIG1pc3NlcyBtZQ%3D%3D)
